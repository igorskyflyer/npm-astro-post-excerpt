When working with the `Terminal` in VS Code on Windows one the most frequent difficulty that all developers face is that the `Terminal` doesn't pick up local Node binaries, installed via [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install).

<br />

For example when working in an npm project and after successfully installing [**`aria`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@igor.dvlpr/aria), if one tries to run it from the `Terminal` will see the following error:

<br />
<br />

> 🤔 But why does this occur?

On Windows, system-wide `PATH` works correctly in the `Terminal` but the `Terminal` doesn't pick up local environment paths, thus, it cannot find any of the binaries that you want to execute.

To fix it we will need to add a setting inside the current user profile in VS Code and everything will work as expected. 💡

<br />

Navigate to your user profile's Settings by clicking on the cog icon ⚙️ at the bottom of your Activity Bar. When the Settings tab has opened, click on the smaller cog icon ⚙️ at the top right of the tab. That should get you to the current user profile's Settings file in JSON.

This is where the magic happens! 🪄

Add the following code to your Settings JSON file:

```json
"terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
	"PATH": "${workspaceFolder}\\node_modules\\.bin;${workspaceFolder}\\bin;${env:PATH}"
}
```

This will effectively allow you to run your current project's Node/npm binaries and the package's own exported binaries!

<br />

> ❗**Note**: you'll need to kill your current Terminal session and start a new one, to refresh the environment variables. If that doesn't work, restart VS Code itself.

<br />

That's it folks, let me know if it helped you fix a common pitfall. 😊
